# Agents

### Rational Agents

= chooses whichever action maximizes the expected value of the performance measure (do the right thing given what is known)

### Rationality

rational is not: 
- omniscient (perception may not supply all relevant information)
- clairvoyant (outcomes may not be as expected)
- successful

rational is: 
- exploration
- learning
- autonomy

task environment is specified with PEAS (Performance measure - how we know that the agent did the right task, Environment - environment that the agent operates in, Actuators - something that allows the agent to act, Sensors - things that the agent can use to receive information)

for example, automated taxi:
- performance measure could be safety, destination, profits, legality, comfort, etc.
- environment could be US streets, freeways, traffic, pedestrians, weather, etc.
- actuators could be steering, accelerator, brake, horn, speaker, display, etc.
- sensors could be video, accelerometers, gauges, engine sensors, keyboard, GPS

## Activity

Worked on doing the PEAS with other examples of agents. Think about different IoT applications that are interesting.
