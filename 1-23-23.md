# Agents

### Weak AI vs Strong AI

There are certain things that are common sense/empathetic that is impossible to transfer into a computer. Also, subconscious is at play.

artifical super-intelligence = where the computer is better than humans

### Restricting the definition of an agent

agents = computer-program with some extra characteristics (something that does something in the given environment)

instead of intelligence, we want the agent to acheive rationality

what other things do we want the agent to have?
- autonomy (being able to fulfill the tasks without human intervention)
- structural reactivity (perceive and react to changes in the environment)
- social ability (interact with other agents and humans)
- pro-activity (exhibit goal-directed behavior by taking the initiative instead of just reacting)

some other things that would be helpful for agents:
- mobility (move around on an electronic network)
- veracity (not spreading false information knowingly)
- benevolence (not having conflicting goals)
- rationality (achieve the goal set for it instead of preventing it)

### Agents vs Objects

difference between oop and aop:
- in oop:
    - we define everything
    - we use parameters to define the programming
    - unconstrained messages
    - no constraints on methods
    - objects have identity, state, and behavior and communicate via messages
- in aop:
    - agents have identity, state (knowledge, beliefs, desires, intentions), and behavior (goal-acheiving, actions, reactions), and communication abilities
    - exhibit autonomy
    - exhibit reactive social behavior
    - persistent and able to learn and adapt
    - control in multi-agent systems

** objects do not have these characterisitics

- volition (able to judge their results and then modify their behavior to improve)
- anthropomorphoc (they are *modeled* after human intelligence -- does not mean that they are intelligent in the human sense)

#### Group Think Tank

- design an oop solution and an aop solution for a car wash tank
    - oop solution: basic robotic car wash that doesn't react to it's environment or to user interface (just doing what it is programmed to do over and over again)
    - aop solution: robotic car wash that can control the different aspects of a car wash (whether it will dispense a certain amount of soap, wax, water depending on what kind of car it is) and they are reactive to the environment (will stop if they sense something other than a car, will have the ability to warm up/cool down based on the weather). It can also distinguish between different types of 'dirtiness' and use this to gauge their material usage
- identify why it is an oop or an aop
    - it is an oop because it doesn't take variance of the environment into account when going through their instructions
    - it is an aop because it is reactive, takes into account its environment, and can 'learn' from continuous use (vehicle recognition)
- list agents and objects for both solutions

### Simple Reflex Agent

- has sensors that can sense the environment and act accordingly, with a state that takes into account whether their actions would be rational for the current state of the environment

### Goal Based Agent

same as reflex-based except that it takes the end programmed goal where the actions will do everything they can to maximize their goal (maximum utility to goal)

### Learning Agent

a combination of all the different agents where it uses all of its information to make decisions
